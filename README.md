# Rust Ray Tracer: A Learning Experience

This is a simple ray tracer written in Rust, based on the wonderful book series, [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io). It is currently in pre-alpha, and has no stable components. 

## About

I began this project with three purposes in mind: 

1. Get better at Rust
2. Learn graphics programming
3. Create a ray tracer I can use for rendering procedurally generated landscapes
